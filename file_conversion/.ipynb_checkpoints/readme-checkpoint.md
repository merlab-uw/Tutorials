[PGD Spider](http://www.cmpg.unibe.ch/software/PGDSpider/) is a program for converting among filetypes, to help you work across programs in population genetics. It has both a GUI version and a command line version. First, we'll walk through the GUI version.

Once you open the application, you'll need to specificy the path to your input and output files, as well as the file formats for each (e.g., VCF, genepop, structure, etc.). You'll also need to specificy a bunch of options, which you can save in a SPID file. Here's what the application window looks like.

As an example, let's convert a VCF file to a Genepop file.






(The command line version is used liked this)
